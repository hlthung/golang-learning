// According to Calhoun, Go is awesome for building CLI that distribute to different OS,
// As Go simply converts / compiles the code into a binary file for any given platform
// while Java needs the JVM to interpret compiled code. However, below articles does mention
// the limitation of Go and did a comparison between Java and Go.

// https://www.turing.com/blog/golang-vs-java-which-language-is-best/
// Note: This behavior actually made Go faster than Java on almost every benchmark.
// This is due to how it is compiled: Go doesnâ€™t rely on a virtual machine to compile its code.
// It gets compiled directly into a binary file. Because Go does not have the VM, it is faster.
// But that that VM also helps Java work on more platforms
